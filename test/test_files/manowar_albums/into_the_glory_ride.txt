1. Warlord


When you see me comin' flying down the road
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin
Black'n'chrome flashin' through the town.
Some call me the WARLORD 'cause I'm a god-damn
bad machine, young'n'hungry, not too proud'n'mean
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,
Riding, riding, riding, ain't never growin' old.
Take what I want and I go where I please
Got the world right by the balls. This world ain't
big enough to keep me down. Yea we're livin'
in a sick world. The man on the T.V. said we
got lotsa trouble overseas, well what the hell
do I care? Think they care about me?
Stop sending money send'em all a bomb.
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,
Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.
Born to live in the fast lane on a chopped up
Harley-D, smell that oil and high test gasoline.
Never got a shortage of girls to share my seat.
Well they all want to know what people say is true,
You know, get a biker started 'n he'll drive all
damn night. Well hold on honey 'cause this ride's
for a ride.
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
I'm the WARLORD of the road.
Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.


2. Secret Of Steel


Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.


3. Gloves Of Metal


Hear the pounding army of the night
The call of metal summons us tonight
And gather we on this site
To behold the power and the might
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night
Off with the lights, hear the screams
See the banging heads awaken to their dreams.
The sound of metal so loud it cracks the beams
Played by warriors called the Metal Kings.
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call.
We are together, we are all.
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand.
Hands high forever we'll be there,
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call.
We are together, we are all.
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand.
Hands high forever we'll be there,
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea
Leather, Metal, Spikes and Chains
Gloves of Metal raised to show the brave.
Into the darkness march the armies of the night.
Bound by metal we live the fight.
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand.
Hands high forever we'll be there,
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea


4. Gates Of Valhalla


Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.


5. Hatred


I taste your blood as it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
HATRED


6. Revelation (Death's Angel)


Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.


7. March For Revenge (By The Soldiers Of Death)


Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
